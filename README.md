# Project 0

It's Quarantime! Broken style sheets, non-responsive images, and SASS that doesn't work can be found by following the links to their various locations! Get drunk, stay at home, happy pandemic!

I've been spending too much time on project0. I'm not sure which skill is the most marketable, but if I fail to git bash it to where it needs to be one more time I'll probably stab my laptop with a wooden stake.
